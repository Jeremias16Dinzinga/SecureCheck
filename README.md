## About SecureCheck

The SecureCheck is a Secure User Behavior Evaluation System is a project aimed at addressing the concerns of users within a system who have reported instances of insecurity in their accounts due to hacking attempts. The project entails the development of a behavior control and analysis center using Laravel, a PHP framework known for its robustness and security features. The system will be designed to detect and diagnose inappropriate user behavior based on predefined rules to enhance the overall security and confidence of users within the system.

## Problem Statement:
The system faces a significant challenge with a large number of users reporting security breaches in their accounts, primarily due to hacking attempts. This has led to a decline in user confidence and satisfaction, prompting users to express their dissatisfaction to the system creators.

## Objectives:
1. Develop a behavior control and analysis center using Laravel to monitor user activities within the system.
2. Implement rules to detect and diagnose inappropriate user behavior, thereby enhancing security.
3. Specifically, enforce rules such as restricting user profiles to one device at a time and limiting consecutive failed login attempts to mitigate hacking risks.

## Features:
1. User Behavior Monitoring: The system will continuously monitor user activities to detect any suspicious behavior.
2. Rule-Based Analysis: Predefined rules will be implemented to analyze user behavior and identify potential security threats.
3. Device Profile Management: Users will be restricted from accessing their profiles simultaneously from multiple devices to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Login Attempt Control: The system will limit the number of consecutive failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
5. Real-time Alerts: Administrators will receive real-time alerts for any detected violations of behavior rules, enabling prompt action to mitigate security risks.

## Technology Stack:
- Laravel PHP Framework: Used for developing the behavior control and analysis center due to its robustness, security features, and ease of development.
- MySQL Database: Utilized for storing user data, behavior logs, and system configurations.
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies for user interface development and interaction with the system.

## Outcome:
The SecureCheck System aims to enhance the security and confidence of users within the system by effectively monitoring and analyzing user behavior. By implementing strict rules and real-time monitoring, the system will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hacking attempts, thereby improving overall user satisfaction and trust in the system.
